# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Developer Ilene
Your answer: Object-oriented programming is the focus of using objects to code. For example, Ruby is a coding language that uses object-oriented programming to function. It is different than functional programming because object-oriented programming uses objects as well as less functionality. In other words, functional programming uses more functions and functionality. Ex: In JavaSciript, in order to capitalize a string in an array, which uses functional programming, you need to find the index of the word you wish to capitalize and you use toUpperCase. While object-oriented programming allows you to call on the string you want to capitalize and use .capitalize

Researched answer: A style of programming with the use of objects closely linked with methods. Object-oriented programming uses objects and methods while functional programming uses functional factors like variables and functions.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Developer Adrian
Your answer: Ruby embraces implicit returns, a feature that eliminates the need for the "return" keyword when the final expression in a code path acts as the return value. In ruby's default state, "return" without an explicit argument yields "nil,"

Researched answer: In Ruby, implicit returns are a feature where you don't need to use the "return" keyword if the last expression in a code path serves as the return value. It's important to keep in mind that by default, "return" without an explicit argument returns "nil," which is considered a falsey value. Depending on the specific context and purpose of the code in a method, returning "nil" may or may not be essential.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Developer Anabella
Your answer: A block in Ruby always has an "end" and it is similar to a "code - block" from Javascript.

Researched answer: Ruby blocks are mini functions that are passed through methods. Ruby blocks begin with a "do" and end in an "end" OR they end between these: {}. Ruby blocks can also contain many arguments. For Ruby blocks you don't need to define a name and it is always necessary to pass a method call.

4. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Developer Mal
Your answer: A single value can be extracted from a Ruby hash by specifying the value and key in this syntax: example_hash["example value"]

Researched answer: If the key doesn't exactly match a key within the hash it will return nil

5. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Developer Roniel
Your answer: a version manager is a program that manages the different builds of a package manager.

Researched answer: Version management deals with managing files of any type or size. It archives, logs changes, restores previous file versions and coordinates access. Github would be an example of a version manager.

more content: to initial answer maybe adding more context. A file manager that can handle different data types and being able to share amongst different repos. More on it's good management.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: 
A development practice that involves writing the test before the code. Focuses on inputs and outputs.

2. PostgreSQL: 
A reputable database that manages data for many apps and websites. Organization!

3. CRUD:
Create Read Update Delete. 4 main actions a user would be able to make
